# Flow

FLow is a utility which demonstrates the surveillance of location through use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to track the location of an entity or object remotely. The tool can pinpoint longitude, latitude, ground speed, and course direction of the target.

Application is a standalone application and run on Android devices with SDK version 15 or higher.

When users open “Flow”, a map will be displayed with their location along with a button to start tracking their location. This button automatically creates a new route based on users’ location and movement. Application also provides an ability to pause tracking, for example, in order to stop by a convenient store, then continue tracking with your present route as long as you do not hit the finish button. Since user deicides to stopping tracking and click on Finish button, application will terminate tracking process and require he/she insert information of the route. In case you are in hurry, you can skip this step and finish it later through View Details page.
